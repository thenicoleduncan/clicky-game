<h1>The Clickster<h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Clicky Game is a web game application where users click images of <em>cute</em> puppies in order to earn points.  You win the game whenever you have clicked all 8 of the puppies.  The only catch is that the puppies move in their location with every click... </li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React.js- UI</li>
  <li>Bootstrap- CSS framework</li>
</ul>

<h4>Components</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Card
      <p>The card component is where the puppy images are displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Score
    <p>The score component is where the score is displayed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Wrapper
    <p>The Wrapper component wraps the card component.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>I chose not to do a separate header component but it could be done.  In fact, you could have the header component include some of the score details.</p>
